# Airflow with Docker

## Running and Stopping Docker

1. Activate python virtual environment using: `source venv/bin/activate`
2. Check what docker containers are running with `docker ps`.
3. If no containers are running, use `docker-compose up -d`
4. To clean up when done, use `docker-compose down -v`
